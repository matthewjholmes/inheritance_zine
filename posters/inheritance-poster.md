<h4><i>Commentary courtesty of <a href="{{ '/contributors/kelsey.html' | relative_url }}">Kelsey Lansang</a></i></h4>
- The contemporary poster uses blue as the background color with red used as the primary accent color. The red is used to fill in the blood and text. 
- Blue symbolizes the police force. The blue and red together suggests America and politics, and this poster specifies the police force in America which has become highly politicized in modern times.
- The modern poster also borrows symbolism from Michelangelo’s <i>Creation of Adam</i> which illustrates the moment God gives Adam the spark of life. This is paralleled in the contemporary poster wherein the older generation hands the gun to the newer generation, essentially giving them life. 
- Visual similarities between the 2 posters include the hand-drawn lettering and screen print style.
