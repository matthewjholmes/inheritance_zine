Bio: I’m a Burmese artist and designer based in San Francisco, working across Graphic Design, Industrial Design, Photography, and Art. At first, I didn’t know what my career path would be. But when Myanmar fell under military rule in 2021, everything changed. Through that experience, I turned to design as a <strong>powerful</strong> tool for <strong>advocacy</strong>, creating protest posters and raising awareness through visual communication.
