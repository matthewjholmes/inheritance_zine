When I think about police brutality in the context of the poster from the 1968 San Francisco
State strike entitled “Happiness Is a Warm Club.” It’s poking fun at the police and is sort of a
bitter joke, but also a warning. The student or students who made it weren’t only reacting to the
personal violence of the club. They were calling out a system that had no way of being checked
and was running rampant. A system without real accountability is one where a club can make
someone feel power over another rather than responsibility for them. When I look at both the
events of 1968 on campus and the countless cases from the last decade, I realize I am thinking
less about the brutality alone and more about how we can stop and hold those accountable that
are continuing the pain. How do we build real paths toward justice? What policies would actually
make a difference?

The 1968 strike showed how the police can escalate a situation in seconds and completely
misrepresent the meaning of a protest. But it also showed that when communities demand
accountability, even imperfectly, they create the pressure necessary for change. And that
pressure is still needed. In 2020, when the George Floyd protests sprouted up across the country
and New York’s Civil Complaint Review Board confirmed misconduct by more than 140 NYPD
officers, it felt like another moment when the public could no longer pretend these were isolated
incidents. I remember seeing video after video of clubs being used on people who were already
backing up and not being violent, and pepper spray being used on these crowds that were no
threat. These moments made me think about how there is no accountability for these actions and
the only way for them to be investigated is internally. That in itself is how the “warm club” stays
warm. When you are able to move unchecked, you continue the violence and abuse because you
do not think there will be repercussions. One way to combat this and have some form of 
accountability is to have an independent oversight committee with real disciplinary power, that
doesn't just advise the police.

Daunte Wright’s killing in 2021in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota by officer Kimberly Potter
showed another area where reform and accountability is needed. The lack of meaningful training
and clear standards. A twenty-year-old died because an officer “mistook” her gun for a taser,
something that should not even be possible in a system that is supposed to be centered on safety.
The protests that followed were met with flash-bangs, tear gas, and impact rounds, showing once
again how badly we need strict national standards for crowd-control weapons. “Less lethal”
doesn’t mean less harmful. It often just means the harm is easier to justify.

Across the 2020–2023 protests, nearly a thousand documented cases of police brutality revealed
patterns we’ve seen for decades force used haphazardly, weapons brought to inflict pain and
punishment rather than protect, and officers hiding badges to avoid accountability. Yet with all
these issues, I don’t just see despair and no light at the end of the tunnel. I see opportunities for
real change. When I look at 2020 and even now, I see a lot of similarities to 1968 and the issues
occurring then, but I also see where we have improved and where we can do better. We can push
for and demand independent oversight, clear national force standards, bans on dangerous crowdcontrol tools, mandatory transparency, and de-escalation training.

The “Warm Club” poster captured a feeling of hopelessness at a time when police violence felt
inevitable. But it also gives me hope because someone saw the issue and was not quiet, and also
we’re not trapped in that moment. Each generation before and since has fought and added new
tools, not weapons, but ideas for reshaping how policing works. And if we keep pushing for 
policies rooted in humanity, accountability, and protection rather than power, then maybe
someday the warm club poster will be a memory of what was and not what is.
