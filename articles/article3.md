During the San Francisco State University BSU and TWLF students strike during 1968 through 1969, police officers were sent down in riot gear to keep the students under control. They carried batons, wore face shields, had tear gas, and shotguns. Students during this strike were fighting for Black and Ethnic studies courses, and also an end to racist admission policies in the school. During this protest, a professor at SF State University named Dennis Beall created the poster, <em>Happiness is a Warm Gun</em> which is a background of bold colors of red, white, and black. On the poster is an image of a police officer with a rather disturbing, joyful look on his face holding what appears to be a baton while the words on the poster say “Happiness is a Warm Club” referring to the baton.

The phrase of this poster was not created out of the blue but was actually taken from the song by The Beatles <em>Happiness is a Warm Gun.</em> The lore does not stop there. one of The Beatles members, John Lenon, explained that the title of their song actually came from an article that was in the NRA’s magazine “American Rifleman” which was glorifying the feeling of a just fired gun being “warm” while in the shooter's hands. John Lenon took those words because he thought it was disturbing enough to satirize and critique of America's obsession with guns. This poster takes the irony of this further. By replacing the word “gun” with “club” Dennis shifted the target from gun obsession and culture to the police officers themselves&mdash;specially the violence and brutality towards the students during the SF State Strike. 

The poster employs a number propagandist methodologies. The colors of the poster are bold and loud and the words are simple, yet effective. The policeman is drawn cartoonishly and is disturbingly joyful. The red is dominating the background as a whole and that is what really grabs and pulls the reader/viewer into the poster. Red can and often does symbolize danger, emergency, and even blood. But as it is also associated with love, the artist was also trying to piece together an inference of the officers emotions as well. This twists the message into seeming that the officer loves to wreak the violence he is causing to the students. Another way that this poster ties into emotions is the way that the word "happiness" is outlined in black, creating a sense that his happiness is trapped. His happiness is perverted, this isn't what real happiness feels like; it is the happiness that is screwed into police systems to make officers believe that violence is good, it is the way of things. 

Even though this poster was created over 50 years ago, this directly relates to what is happening today with police brutality, Black Lives Matter, and the lack of justice that people receive in the cases where excessive force is used. Black Lives Matter was formed because in the wake of events that happened in the past like police using harsh violence with little to no punishment for their actions, especially against black communities and other minorities. This poster is special and important because it shows how perennial this issue is. It could equally appear in protests that are happening today. The style of the poster and the horror and humor mix to expose and emphasize injustice. The satire, the bright, bold background, and the cartoon smile are elements that translat across generations because the violence still hasn't stopped. This poster is art, serving as a reminder that the systems that students here at San Francisco State resisted 50 years ago still are active today and until that changes, <em>Happiness is a Warm Club</em> will continue to be relevant.
