When a coalition of the Black Student Union and the Third World Liberation Front began a strike at San Francisco State College in 1968, their efforts were initially limited to a relatively small number of students and a handful of professors. However, it quickly evolved into a massive demonstration and ultimately became the longest college campus-based strikes in American history. As the intensity of protest rose precipitously, the College administration quickly determined that they needed to turn over responsibility for order to an outside agency. At this point, officers from San Francisco Police Department, California Highway Patrol, and other agencies deployed to the campus and prepared to engage in, using the parlance of the time, “riot control.” Contemporary photographs and eyewitness accounts attest that this consisted of two primary tactics: the baton charge, and the dispersal of CS (“tear”) gas. More recent crowd control doctrine teaches a wider variety of techniques, and many of them are less offensive to sensibilities when viewed on a video screen. This raises a sharp question about the tools police use to influence a protest. Has the modernization of crowd control tools actually made policing more humane, or simply more publicly palatable?

The protest poster entitled “Happiness is a Warm Club” captures a perception that many in the crowd had. Baton charges are nominally intended to force a crowd out of an area. However, they are typically ineffective in all but the smallest of crowds, because while knots of the public who are closest to the police line will indeed flee, they will quickly have nowhere to flee to: the main body of the crowd cannot move quickly enough, nor will the main body experience the same feeling of threat, as those on the front lines effectively put it out of range of the melee. At this point, police would characteristically proceed to strike with their batons in a manner often described as indiscriminate. Because the behavior did not appear to be a directed effort focused on achieving some specific law enforcement end, this led to the wide-spread perception that many of the officers were deriving personal satisfaction or pleasure from producing pain and injury.
Though there was abundant still and motion picture evidence of this kind of excess, it received little attention in the press. Thus, there was little public censure of the police tactics. In recent decades, the proliferation of cell phone videos, security cameras, and eventually body-worn police cameras has dramatically altered the documentary landscape, all of which, when coupled with social media platforms, have conspired to generate public distaste for this style of crowd control. Public order policing still does use batons, but they are usually employed in different tactics. Riot shields have become ubiquitous, and batons have been relegated to a secondary role.

A lucrative industry has arisen to create alternative, higher-technology tools that reduce the need for “hands-on” use of force. Among the most common in the United States are newer delivery methods for chemical irritants (such as pepper-balls, shot from a paintball marker), disorientation devices like flash-bang grenades and blast balls, and the so-called less-lethal impact projectiles (rubber or plastic bullets, beanbag shotgun rounds, and others). Conducted electricity weapons like TASERs are sometimes also included in this group, though they are less commonly used in a crowd setting. More devices are in development and trials.

From the viewpoint of the police agency, these tools do offer a number of advantages. They promise more control with less blood. They can affect larger groups of people who would otherwise be out of reach. They reduce the risk to the officer. And, importantly, they are cosmetically much more tolerated by the general public watching. In parallel, new terminology has been advanced which de-emphasizes the underlying fact that these are all uses of force. For example, the use of pepper-balls, flash-bangs, and beanbags can all be described as “crowd dispersal.”

Public health reviews have observed that all of these methods have produced, at times, severe injuries and occasionally death. Broken bones, head trauma, and blindness have all been documented. At the same time, these reviews emphasize that these newer methods are also indiscriminate—even more than a swung club might be. They affect wide areas and often cannot be targeted to exclude non-participatory bystanders in the general area.

Further, the strategic efficacy of these methods is hardly clear. The data measuring subsequent protest intensity, injury rates and patterns, and impact on public trust are decidedly mixed. Some recent academic work suggests that the use of impact projectiles on crowds may actually correlate with an increase in the size and number of protests in the days after, and that those protests see higher rates of injuries to both protesters and police, as well as more property damage.
The broad acceptance of these methods by the populace, may, in fact, produce less restraint on the part of the police than they might otherwise demonstrate. Recent developments, such as the heavy-handed federal implementation of immigration raids and response to associated protests, suggest that police may be reverting to more aggressive tactics; pepper-balls shot at close range to the head, volleys of stun grenades in enclosed urban spaces, and liberal use of beanbag and foam rounds have all been used. The government may then use the label of “less-lethal” as effective political cover to diffuse the public backlash against the evident resurrection of the grinning riot cop who lusts to produce pain and injury.
