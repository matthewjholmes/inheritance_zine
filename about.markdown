Let's just call this page a little Easter egg that may or may not be an artifact of the Jekyll infrastructure. Creating this website has been, in turns, fun and frustrating. While this project was ongoing, I was busy deciding that a Computer Science degree really wasn't a good fit for me. I was having a hellish time in Calculus, and decided to transfer to Public Health. I do think that'll be a better fit for me.

But I don't like failing at stuff and so in some ways this website was really guilding the lily for the requirements of the class, but it was a low-stakes way for me to redeem the practicality of my nascent programming skills. I don't claim that the actual academic content that the contributors submitted is especially groundbreaking stuff, but overall, I think this is a pretty decent portfolio site for a 100-level class.
